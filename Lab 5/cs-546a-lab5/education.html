                                    <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
                                     <p>My favourite class at Stevens has been Advanced Algorithms. This course taught me that there is solution to almost every problem. The professor always says that there exsts an algorithm to solve for almost everything. But as a student of Advanced algorithms class, we have to find a way to optimize it.</p>
                                     <aside>Given the limited amount of time that I have spent at Stevens, my good set of memories here include the days when I could spend time during sunset at Castle point. With the astounding view of skyline and a bunch of things that I like to read on my laptop would make it really amazing.  </aside>

                                    <p>My favourite class at SNDT was Cloud Computing.</p>
                                    <aside>My favourite memory from SNDT is when it was our farewell. All of us longed badly to graduate and when we finally did, we didn't want to leave the college!</aside>
